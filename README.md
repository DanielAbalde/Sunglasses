<p align="center">Draw the name (or nickname) of Grasshopper objects with Draw Icons mode on. It also enriches the capsules when you zoom in to understand the component and visualise its data at a quick glance.</p>

## 😎 Overview
The advantage with the alternatives (and the reason for it) is that this is a purely graphic plugin, you don’t need any component to use it, it is modified via toolbar, and it doesn’t create any object inside the canvas either, it only affects the canvas visually. Besides, you look much more stunning with them.
